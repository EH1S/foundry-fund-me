## Foundry

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

- **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
- **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
- **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
- **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.

# Foundry Fund Me üè¶

A Solidity smart contract project built with Foundry that allows users to fund ETH and only the contract owner to withdraw ‚Äî complete with tests, scripts, and mocks.

---

## üì¶ Features

- `FundMe` contract:  
  - Users can fund with ETH  
  - Requires a minimum USD-equivalent amount (via Chainlink price feed)  
  - Only owner can withdraw funds  
  - Includes a more gas-efficient `cheaperWithdraw` variant  

- **Testing** with Forge:  
  - Mock price feed (MockV3Aggregator)  
  - Tests covering funding, withdrawals, edge cases (insufficient funds, multiple funders)  

- **Deployment script**  
  - `DeployFundMe.s.sol` uses `HelperConfig` for network-specific price feed addresses  
  - Supports local/forked/testing & live networks  

- **Formatting / linting / CI**  
  - `forge fmt` enforced in GitHub Actions  
  - Code style consistency
